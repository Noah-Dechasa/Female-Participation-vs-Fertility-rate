# Abstract
The ongoing global trend indicates a decline in fertility rates concurrent with an increase in female labor force participation. This study delves into the intricate relationship between these two variables within the context of 10 developed countries from 2001 to 2016. Utilizing a fixed-effects model, the research aims to discern how variations in female labor participation, along with other factors such as male labor participation and GDP, impact fertility rates across these nations. The analysis encapsulates a comprehensive review of existing literature, meticulous data collection from the World Bank database, and rigorous econometric modeling to derive meaningful insights into the dynamics at play.

# Introduction
The paper explores the varying relationship between female labor participation and fertility rates across different regions and development levels. Previous studies have shown diverse interactions between these variables, influenced by cultural, religious, and regional factors. This analysis aims to examine whether the observed global trend holds true within 10 developed countries, shedding light on the potential incompatibility between motherhood and employment.

# Literature Review
Various studies have shown both positive and negative relations between female labor participation and fertility rate. While some research demonstrates policies encouraging both fertility and female employment, others indicate a negative short-term impact of fertility on female labor participation. The diverse findings across different geographical and socio-economic settings underline the complex nature of the relationship between these variables.

# Methodology
Employing a fixed-effects model, this research scrutinizes the link between fertility rate and female labor force participation across 10 developed countries from 2001 to 2016. The model controls for various other factors including male labor participation, unemployment rates, GDP, and advanced education, aiming to derive a nuanced understanding of the variables affecting fertility rate.

# Results
The fixed-effects regression analysis unveiled that, at a 10% significance level, female labor participation and GDP are statistically significant variables in predicting fertility rate. A one percent increase in female labor participation over time leads to a reduction in the fertility rate by 0.03028 units, assuming all other variables remain constant. On the other hand, a unit increase in GDP over time results in an increase in the fertility rate by 0.029 units, albeit the t-statistics of -5.74 suggests a possibility of observing this coefficient by chance when there's no correlation between GDP and fertility rate. The results underscore a nuanced negative relationship between female labor participation and fertility rate within economically prosperous countries, aligning with the findings of Mishra, Vinod, and Russell Smyth (2010) across 28 OECD countries.

# Data
The dataset used in this analysis is derived from the World Bank database, encompassing a time span from 2001 to 2016. It includes fertility rate data, female and male labor participation rates, unemployment rates, and GDP for 10 developed countries.

# Code
The code utilized for this analysis is structured in R, providing a step-by-step procedure for data cleaning, model building, and result interpretation. It includes the implementation of the fixed-effects model, various tests for specification, and the generation of relevant visualizations to aid in understanding the findings.
